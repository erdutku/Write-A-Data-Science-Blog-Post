## Project Motivation

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Berlin Airbnb Data to better understand:

1)Which place is the average most expensive accommodation in Berlin?

2)What is the most expensive price on a room type basis?

3)What is the distribution of prices on the basis of latitude and longitude?

4)What is the most correlated three variable with price?

5)Please you can create a model about make a prediction of room price.

## File Descriptions

listings.csv contains (Date Compiled:19 September, 2019) Berlin Germany Airbnb information of listing accommodation including price, latitude, longitude etc.

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my five questions.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://github.com/erdutku/Write-A-Data-Science-Blog-Post/blob/master/Berlin_Airbnb.ipynb) available
