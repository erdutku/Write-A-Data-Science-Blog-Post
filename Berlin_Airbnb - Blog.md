## Part 3 What is the distribution of prices on the basis of latitude and longitude?


```python
listings_df.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", alpha=0.6, figsize=(8,6), 
        c="price", cmap="plasma", colorbar=True ,sharex=False)
```

Distribution of prices is on the basis of latitude and longitude on above side. This distribution shows that accomodation preferences is more center than other place. Generally Kreuzberg and Mitte have been popular place.

## Part 4 What is the most correlated three variable with price?


```python
ax = plt.subplots( figsize=(10,10) )
sns.heatmap(listings_df.corr(),annot=True,linewidths=1)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_14_0.png)


Availability_365 is that the most correlated with price. Correlation is 0.12. I had expected that latitude and longitude was correlated

## Conculsion
